# Csharp-TSP-Client-Server-app
#
This test project contains 2 console applications: client and server. Client starts listening, creating and serializing new instance 
of the class "Point", and sending bytes to the server. Server starts listening, receiving and deserializing bytes, printing instance of the class "Point"
on the screen, and sending (string) answer back to client.
#
This project shows how to work with TCP/IP and serializing/deserializing.
